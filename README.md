# 💼🌐 My Portfolio Website – Gideon Thuku
I am Gideon Thuku. This is my personal portfolio website created for the **PLP Academy July 2025 Hackathon Challenge**. 

This project represents my journey into web development. I come from a background in disability rights advocacy, multimedia production, and AI operations. Through this site, I wanted to blend my personal mission and professional experiences with my growing technical skills.
