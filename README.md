# 💼🌐 My Portfolio Website – Gideon Thuku
I am Gideon Thuku. This is my personal portfolio website created for the **PLP Academy July 2025 Hackathon Challenge**. 

This project represents my journey into web development. I come from a background in disability rights advocacy, multimedia production, and AI operations. Through this site, I wanted to blend my personal mission and professional experiences with my growing technical skills.

The layout is designed to be clean and responsive, using no frameworks, just raw HTML and CSS. I included a background image slideshow to add life to the site, hover effects for interactivity, and well-structured sections for easy navigation.

I also made sure the site is accessible and readable for all users by:
- Using semantic HTML elements
- Including descriptive `alt` text for all images
- Adding `aria-labels` and form labels
- Choosing good contrast colors for readability

This is my first big web project, and I am happy for this little progress
